<p>Section 2.2 - Admission. Membership in KONG Land shall be determined via (1) holding a $CITIZEN ERC-721 token at the Ethereum address 0x355929193308e157760824ba860390924d77fab9 and (2) carrying out an on-chain signature action from the wallet holding the $CITIZEN ERC-721 token whereby the applicant signs the Founding <a href="#Charter"><abbr title="This document, the official legal charter of the Nation3 DAO.">Charter</abbr></a> co-located at <a href="https://charter.kong.land/charter">https://charter.kong.land/charter</a> and on the Arweave blockchain with the document identifier 1HhgIhjmE724U6SHVVhtIFLxGlCLy_h0O4SkA3IDhPY. The signature will be recorded on the Arweave blockchain and can be retrieved by a tag consisting of the wallet address of the <a href="#Citizen"><abbr title="Natural person owning a Passport after entering an agreement with the Nation3 DAO to honor the Nation3 Constitution">Citizen</abbr></a> holder. Only one membership will be granted to one person regardless of the number of $CITIZEN ERC-721 tokens held, and additional steps may be taken to prove personhood as determined by the membership. If the Founding <a href="#Charter"><abbr title="This document, the official legal charter of the Nation3 DAO.">Charter</abbr></a> is amended from time to time as detailed in Section 1.5, Citizens may need to sign the amended Founding <a href="#Charter"><abbr title="This document, the official legal charter of the Nation3 DAO.">Charter</abbr></a> in order to retain voting rights.</p>
<p>Section 2.6 - Inactive status. A <a href="#Citizen"><abbr title="Natural person owning a Passport after entering an agreement with the Nation3 DAO to honor the Nation3 Constitution">Citizen</abbr></a> who falls from good standing may have their membership revoked or suspended through the vote of Membership (each said action, a “Guild Kick/Member Removal”). References herein to the rights and entitlements of members shall be understood to refer only to members in good standing. Good standing will mean participating in at least one vote every two years within KONG Land and not conducting any criminal activity against KONG Land. The definition for good standing, including the minimum voting requirement of one vote every two years, may be updated from time to time as specified by the KONG Land Codex.</p>
<p>Section 5.1 - Redemption. Citizens have no rights of redemption of any working capital, or token assets, held within KONG Land. It is not anticipated that KONG Land will ever turn a “profit” as excess capital will be paid out via charitable donations, grants, or other forms of support meant to carry out the Founding <a href="#Charter"><abbr title="This document, the official legal charter of the Nation3 DAO.">Charter</abbr></a>.</p>
<p>Section 7.3 - Communication by electronic means.
