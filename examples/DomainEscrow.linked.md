This [[Domain Name]] Sale and Ownership Transfer Agreement ("Agreement”) is entered into between [[Seller]] and [[Purchaser]]. This agreement sets forth all terms and conditions under which [[Seller]] agrees to sell and transfer to [[Purchaser]] all ownership rights in and to the domain name [[Domain Name]] including any and all trademark rights and attendant goodwill associated therewith.

## [[Seller]] and the [[Purchaser]] hereby agree as follows:

1. Purchase Price. In consideration for payment of [[Purchase Price]], the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, paid by [[Purchaser]] to [[Seller]], [[Seller]] hereby assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to [[Purchaser]] all of [[Seller]]’s right, title, and interest in and to the [[Domain Name]]. Payment will be made in US dollars.
2. [[Seller]]’s Representations. [[Seller]] represents and warrants that it is the lawful and exclusive registrant of the [[Domain Name]] and no other party has any right to registration of the [[Domain Name]] or has otherwise made any claim to the [[Domain Name]]. [[Seller]] further represents and warrants that it has the exclusive authority to enter into this transaction and transfer the [[Domain Name]], free of the claims of any third parties.
3. Transfer of the [[Domain Name]]. The [[Domain Name]] is registered with [[Registrar]], an ICANN accredited registrar system. Upon confirmation of receipt of [[Purchase Price]], [[Seller]] shall provide [[Purchaser]] with a password or [[Seller]] shall push the [[Domain Name]] to [[Purchaser]]’s account at [[Registrar]] within 2 days of receiving payment. This enables [[Purchaser]] to modify the registration information as desired, transfer the [[Domain Name]] to a different [[Registrar]], and/or to change [[Purchaser]]’s password/username to take full control of the [[Domain Name]].
4. Further Assurances. [[Seller]] shall take all necessary actions, including providing all necessary documentation to [[Purchaser]] in order to transfer [[Domain Name]] to [[Purchaser]].
5. Governing Law. This Agreement is made under and shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Nation3, without regard to that state’s choice of law principles, which may direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.
6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. This Agreement cannot be changed, modified, amended, or supplemented, except in writing signed by all parties hereto.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, [[Seller]] and [[Purchaser]] have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives.
